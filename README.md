// Auction Art Gallery

The purpose of this application is to create an online marketplace that acts as an art gallery/auction.
Users/artists will be able to create accounts, post their artwork for display purposes/critiques/networking/sale, get commision requests, donations, etc.
All users can post their work for display and anyone can place a bid on that specific piece and an auction will begin for a certain period of time until the highest bidder wins.
Searching users accounts will let you see all current and past works of art that are still availible, on hold, or sold.
